# R/BIOCONDUCTOR FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY AND PROTEOMICS

Teaching material: https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/docs/

- Don't hesitate to ask questions and interrupt any time.
- Suggestion for breaks: 5 - 10 minutes every hour, ~ 15 minutes every
  2 hours.
- Audience: learn about mass spectrometry-based proteomics and how to
  handle and analyse such with R (also applicable to
  metabolomics). Familiarity with R expected.
